Look, this ain't mine, I just spent a stupid amount of money on buying skidded gens from the same indians that think $10 is financial freedom, go ahead, sell this, I genuinely don't care too much, hopefully streamlabs do something so then indians in the com can't figure out how to work their terrible API. If you do sell this, make sure to give credit to the one person that helped you! \n\nStar this repo, and follow my github, I'll release more interesting stuff
